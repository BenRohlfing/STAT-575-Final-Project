STAT-575-Final-Project

This project is an application of my STAT 575 class on Statistical Computing in R that I took in the Summer 2019 semester. More specifically, this project aims to figure out the effectiveness of several multivariate normality tests through the comparison of their empirical power.

The STAT 575 Final Project is the code used in the project. The code before the algorithms should be run after the algorithms are run. Everything from line 110 and after is scratch work and can be ignored.

The STAT 575 Final Project RMarkdown is the revised code used in the project in the order that I ran it in R Markdown format.

The STAT 575 Final Project Report is the formal report I submitted in accordance with the analysis of the code that was run and an outline of the problem and the methods that were used.

The STAT 575 Final Project Presentation is the power point used in the presentation I gave in front of the class.
